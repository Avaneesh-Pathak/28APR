    "--->  Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering data points into groups based on their similarities. It involves merging or dividing clusters based on their similarities or dissimilarities until all data points are in one cluster or each is in its own cluster. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, and it produces a dendrogram that shows the hierarchical relationship between clusters. Hierarchical clustering can handle different types of data, including categorical data, and can use different similarity measures, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. It is different from other clustering techniques like K-means and DBSCAN because of these characteristics."

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is widely used because it is simple, intuitive, and flexible.\n",

Divisive hierarchical clustering is less common than agglomerative hierarchical clustering because it is computationally expensive and can be unstable."
